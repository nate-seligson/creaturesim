# creaturesim
This project uses rudiementary neural networks and random number generation to create unique "organisms" that will chase after food. When the creature eats, it reproduces a child with slightly mutated genes, to create a "survival of the fittest" effect.
# Brain
The Neural Network is made up of two matrixes per layer -- One of weights, and one of biases. these are randomized during the creation, and inherited with minor changes 
# Parts
During the creation of each organism, they have a randomly chosen set of parts that can affect their chances of survival.
